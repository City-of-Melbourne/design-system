title: Introduction to DCI Design System
---
Welcome to the DCI Design system. Right now, it’s less a design system, and more of a design library for the Digital Customer Interface.

We hope that this will start CoM on a journey to a comprehensive design system that can be useful for designers, developers, project managers, citizens…. you name it!

## What's DCI? / What does the acronym means? 

Digital Customer Interface.

## Where did that come from? 

Someone in the Digital Services Program (DSP)

## Why does it exist? 

The council teams need a descriptor to hang conversations around the work effort and it’s just stuck over time.

## How is DCI different to the other CoM systems or CASM? 

DCI primarily references an interface, but sometimes can be used to refer to delivery team responsible. CASM is actually now called CMCA – City Marketing and Corporate Affairs, which are a team (CoM love acronyms) ‘MVGA’ or ‘MVGA site’ is often used to refer to the council website.

## Where do they diverge, where do they converge?

Existing MVGA content is used to allow the customer to find what service they are looking for and then access the DCI form.  For example, the graffiti page includes a ‘report’ button (in primary red) to link to the DCI form. Fyi, DSP don’t have authority to make changes to MVGA content, but do make recommendations based on customer research.
