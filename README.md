# City of Melbourne Design System

First step towards creating an open source design system based on the DCI's internal design style guide.

See the live website at:

[https://city-of-melbourne.github.io/design-system/](https://city-of-melbourne.github.io/design-system/)

## Goal

Make the current design style guide (system) open source.

## Benefits


- Scale: Like scalable software but for design
- Open: Increase visibility both internally and externally
- Reuse: both internally and potentially externally
- Take lead in the digital design as council (win design system race against sydney)
- Join the leader: AU government is doing this already
- Kick start a project/prototype/mockup quickly

## Road map

- [x] Static version of the current style guide from a html dump of confluence
- [ ] Generate site form markdown version of the documents (doing)
- [ ] Make components live (html, css, js)
- [ ] Create a front-end framework based on the design system
- [ ] Create starter packs that allows people to get up and running quickly
