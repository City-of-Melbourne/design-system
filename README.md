# City of Melbourne Design System

First step towards creating an open source design system based on the DCI's internal design style guide.

## Goal

Make the current design style guide (system) open source.


## Benefits

- Scale: Like scalable software but for design
- Open: Increase visibility both internally and externally
- Reuse: both internally and potentially externally
- Take lead in the digital design as council (win design system race against sydney)
- Join the leader: AU government is doing this already
- Kick start a project/prototype/mockup quickly


## Road map

- [x] Static version of the current style guide from a html dump of confluence
- [x] Generate site form markdown version of the documents
- [ ] Make components live üëà doing
- [ ] Create a front-end framework based on the design system
- [ ] Create starter packs that allows people to get up and running quickly



## Tips for updating the website

- You need to update the content with markdown, refer to [Github's markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for this.
- It takes 3-10 seconds for the code to generate and update from markdown to the HTML site, so you‚Äôll need some patience to see changes!
- Make sure to keep the ‚Äúlayout‚Äù and ‚Äútitle‚Äù on every page.
- Reference the internal img folder only in order to retrieve image files. Don‚Äôt put the entire location in there. E.g. /img/image.png is correct, and /design-system/components/img/image.png will not work.
- Avoid tables at all costs. If you really, really have to, refer to use github‚Äôs markdown style for it, and you‚Äôll probably have to get a dev to create a style for the website.
- Give a useful description to your commit, for version control e.g. if you change the size of the H1 to 20px, say "Changed H1 to 20px". This makes it easier to see when you changed things, and what you did.

## Suggested workflow

When adding new content, what would probably work best is if you follow these steps:
1. Designer uploads design(s) to the design system (after due diligence regarding ensuring it's the agreed standard)
2. Developer refers to the design(s) uploaded to teh design system and coes them.
3. Once code is ready to be live, replace the images with that code.
4. Profit.
